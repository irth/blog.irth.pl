  <div class="post-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve started a new project two days ago, the idea for which has been in my
head for quite a while, and I&rsquo;ve even managed to implement a proof of concept
in Golang.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that two people log in on a website via Spotify, the app
fetches their music libraries from the Spotify API and computes the
intersection of their music libraries, so they can have a playlist they can
both listen to together.</p>

<p>The name <strong>Project 42</strong> is a codename, &ldquo;42&rdquo; in this case means <em>&ldquo;four two&rdquo;</em>,
because the app helps make playlists <strong>for two</strong> people.</p>

<p>I thought to myself that it might be a good idea to blog the progress, so that
I can keep track of what I learn and reference it later.</p>

<h2>Tech stack</h2>

<p>Originally I wrote the proof of concept in Golang, mainly because I was
fascinated by that language at the time. Now, I wish to learn Ruby on Rails,
so naturally I chose that as the basis for the project.</p>

<p>I knew I needed to be able to run jobs in background (to fetch large music
libraries) and have a way to report the progress to the user. Golang has
wonderful features for that - <a href="https://gobyexample.com/goroutines">goroutines</a>
and <a href="https://gobyexample.com/channels">channels</a>, and the
<a href="https://github.com/gorilla/websocket"><code>gorilla/websocket</code></a> library solves the
progress-reporting problem.</p>

<p>So I began looking for Rails-based alternatives, and turns out Rails has all I
need built in:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Active Job</strong> is a framework provided by Rails for declaring and running
background jobs in queues.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Active Cable</strong> is Rails&rsquo;s solution for websocket communication, it is
built into Rails since the 5th version and also provides a client-side
library.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The last missing part was a library for the Spotify API, but a quick Google
search led me to <a href="https://github.com/guilhermesad/rspotify">RSpotify</a> which
contains everything I need, including an
<a href="https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth">OmniAuth</a> provider.</p>

<hr />

<p>I really hope I can finish this project this time. I&rsquo;ll try to come up with
some deadlines to make sure I stay focused and I&rsquo;ll try to post a progress
update whenever I reach a deadline. Well, that&rsquo;s it for today.</p>

  <div class="post-content"><h1>N-th post</h1>

<p>This is not the first time I start a blog, so it&rsquo;s not really a first post, but I guess I want to try again.</p>

<p>Every few months I realise I am wasting most of the time, and that time has come again. I&rsquo;ve spent last week or so basically just watching Netflix all day, and finished the week by drinking till 4AM and then puking 4 kilograms out the next day. That probably means I should get my shit together, and I hope that documenting my journey here will help me do just that.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a few things I want to change.</p>

<h4>What?</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>My weight</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m about to reach 100kg, so I definitely need to get a bit fitter.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Productivity - personal</strong><br />
I haven&rsquo;t been coding much lately, and I hardly ever finish any projects.
I feel like I&rsquo;ve stopped learning anything few years ago and I really need to change that.
There&rsquo;s a cool project I have in mind, and I need to make sure I don&rsquo;t abandon it halfway through, like I usually do.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Productivity - work</strong><br />
I have been hired to do a project via <a href="https://freelancer.com">freelancer.com</a>, and even though the contract specifies just 3 hours of work per week I still find it hard to make myself do it, and I tend to put it off as much as I can. When I do that I feel even worse because I feel like I&rsquo;m being dishonest to my employer. And because I feel worse, it&rsquo;s even harder to do anything and I end up sleeping in the middle of the day.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>School</strong>
I&rsquo;m kinda doing okay in school but it&rsquo;s mostly because of luck, which results in being anxious every day because I&rsquo;m never sure whether something will come up, like a test or whatever that I didn&rsquo;t know about. It also makes me worry about my finals, because if I keep relying on luck it might not be enough to get into the university.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>How?</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Weight</strong> - I plan on working out every day with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popularapp.sevenmins&amp;hl=en">this app</a>. I&rsquo;ve tried running, inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1hoOwbfgME">exurb1a</a>, but I quickly figured out that I absolutely hate running. The solution - I bought inline skates and it&rsquo;s just so much more fun, and - according to Endomondo - I can easily burn as much calories as when running, even though it&rsquo;s way less tiring.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Productivity</strong> - There&rsquo;s the project I mentioned, and I&rsquo;ll begin with just finishing that for now.
The project is pretty simple, it&rsquo;s a web app that allows two people to log in via Spotify and it finds the intersection of their music libraries. I&rsquo;ll try to write at least one blog post about it.<br />
After that, I&rsquo;d like to finally learn how to make Android apps or websites in Django. I probably should read a book or two on web design and CSS, because I pretty much suck at it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Work</strong> - well that&rsquo;s easy. I just need to make a daily routine and include like, an hour every day for working. If I can work consistently for a few weeks, I&rsquo;ll try to find more work, because money.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>School</strong> - pretty much the same thing as above.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is, I&rsquo;ve more-or-less already tried to do those things a few times, and of course I failed. Why is it going to be different this time? Well - I&rsquo;m documenting it. I hope that because my progress is publicly visible, I&rsquo;ll have an incentive to not fuck it up again. I plan on making weekly progress updates.</p>

<p>I am aware this post consists mostly of incoherent rambling but I am glad I put it all out there.</p>

<p>To sum it all up,</p>

<h3>A TODO for the next week starting tomorrow (8-13.05.2018)</h3>

<ul>
<li>do HICT with the 7 Minute Workout app every day</li>
<li>1 hour freelancing every day</li>
<li>1 hour coding every day</li>
<li>1 hour studying every day</li>
<li>make a schedule</li>
</ul>

<p>See you next monday, then.</p>

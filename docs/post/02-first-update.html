  <div class="post-content"><h1>First update</h1>

<p>I ended my last post with</p>

<pre><code>See you next Monday, then.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, that was a lie, because I gave up before the week ended and didn&rsquo;t have much to write about.</p>

<p>I did manage to do the required 3h of coding, and studied for about 2 hours, but that wasn&rsquo;t even close to the goal.</p>

<p>Of course, that demotivated me even further so I just stopped caring again.</p>

<p>But I finally have an update for you!<br />
I noticed that one of the biggest obstacles on my road to productivity is my smartphone.<br />
I am addicted and can&rsquo;t focus when I have Netflix and all of the social media within the reach of my hand.</p>

<p>To solve that, I asked my mother for help. We&rsquo;ve agreed to designate 2 hours daily for studying, from 5 to 7 p.m., and during that time she takes away my phone to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t distract me.<br />
So far it has mostly worked.</p>

<p>And after those 2 hours I can stop studying without feeling bad about it, because that&rsquo;s what we agreed to.<br />
It is way easier to focus on other things, like work, without the feeling that I should be studying instead.</p>

<p>Starting today afternoon I have about 4 days free from school, so that should boost my productivity too.</p>

<p>Hopefully the next update will come on time!</p>

<p><small>By the way, I wrote this on an Android phone. I used iA Writer as the editor, and published using the regular command-line git, provided by Termux! I used to have a phone that had an actual Linux distro (Maemo) but I&rsquo;d say that Android with Termux is close enough for me. I did have to install Arch Linux in a chroot to make timezones work properly, though.</small></p>
